# Fibonacci sequence output, JSON parsing
The FibonacciAlgorithm class asks for the required number of sequence numbers and outputs the corresponding sequence of Fibonacci numbers.
The Parser class starts processing the JsonParsing class and checks for exceptions.
The JsonParsing class reads data from a .json file and prints all keys and their corresponding objects to the console.
